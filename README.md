# Welcome to Cabin Scheduler

A helpful scheduling assistant

# What is Cabin Scheduler?

A scheduling application to assist with scheduling time at the cabin between multiple family members.  This is app was built with Node.js, Javascript, Sequelize, Google calendar, Node-mailer and is deployed on Heroku.

# The app will do the following:
  - Inform the family member (via email) whose turn it is to select their dates at the cabin. 
  - Send a confirmation email to user once dates are selected.
  - Show who is on deck for selecting next. 
  - Will rotate through the roster moving the person that made their choice to the bottom of the list. 

# Future Upgrades:
- Have a login/new user page where new users will get added into the roster once registered.
- Have a features page where users could blog.
- Have the roster change up the order for scheduling year to year.
